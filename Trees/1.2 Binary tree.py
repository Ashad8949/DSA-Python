# Binary Tree: atmost two children (left, right)
# BT:(family of data structure)
# i.e.----->(BST, Heap tree, AVL, red black trees, Syntax tree)
# Use
# Huffman coding problem, heap priority problem and expressinon parsing problem

# Types of Binary Trees 
1. Full Binary Tree (0 or 2 children)
2. Perfect Binary Tree (all nodes have 2 children and leaf node at same level)
3. Complete Binary
4. Balaced Binary Tree 
----> All leaf node is located in the same distance from root node
